## Data

Data for this project came from Kaggles Tree Cover Type competition which consists of 7 types of trees to be classified based upon available landscape features. 

## Scope

This project focused on identifying 30m square plots of land as belonging to one tree type. 



## Baseline Modeling

Initially many models were considered. Both randomsearch and gridsearch were performed in order to discover the optimal parameters for tuning each model to maximize recall. 
## Final Modeling

## Next Steps

First steps going forward would be to continuing fine tuning the XGBoost and RandomForest models to improve performance.
